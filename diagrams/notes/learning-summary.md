# Learning Summary

This project helped me understand:

- How to create and configure an AWS VPC.
- The difference between public subnets and private subnets.
- How Internet Gateways and route tables enable internet access.
- How Security Groups and Network ACLs work together to secure resources.
- Basic traffic flow inside a VPC and to/from the internet.

This is part of my DevOps/DevSecOps learning journey, focusing on cloud networking and security fundamentals.
